/* Polaris: everything a maintainer may change. No secrets: the site is public.

   APP.env picks the tables. Production and the test copies differ only in the
   links under TABLES (and the "Test copy" badge that follows from APP.env). On
   every load the page re-checks each field it uses (name, type and the select
   options it writes) and refuses to push if anything is missing, so a renamed
   column fails loudly instead of writing bad data. Node scripts import this file
   too, so keep it free of browser APIs. */
